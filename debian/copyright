 gendy~ - an implementation of Iannis Xenakis' Dynamic
 Stochastic Synthesis as an object for Pure Data.
 .
 This project uses Thomas Grill's Flext framework, which
 is necessary to compile and run it.

 Gendy is an external for Pure Data and Max/MSP based on Iannis Xenakis'
 Dynamic Stochastic Synthesis.
 .
 The library implementing DSS is decoupled from the Pure Data and Max/MSP
 external code, so it should be relatively easily embeddable in other projects.
 .
 For an excellent explanation of DSS, see Sergio Luque's master's thesis:
 http://www.sergioluque.com/thesis.html
 .
 One of the departures from cannonical DSS is the introduction of "target waveforms"
 that the breakpoints gravitate towards. Currently only sinusoidal and square waves
 are implemented, but implementing new waveforms is trivial, I just haven't done it
 yet.
